- Use the arrow keys or `hjkl` to move around a webpage (vim-like syntax is used in quite a few places)
- To zoom in or out of a webpage, use the `+` or `-` keys respectively
- To go to a new webpage, press `o`, then type a url, then press Enter (Use `O` to open the url in a new tab, `go` to edit the current URL)
- If what you’ve typed isn’t a url, then a search engine will be used instead (DuckDuckGo, by default)
- To switch between tabs, use `J` (next tab) and `K` (previous tab), or press `<Alt-num>`, where `num` is the position of the tab to switch to
- To close the current tab, press `d` (and press `u` to undo closing a tab)
- Use `H` and `L` to go back and forth in the history
- To click on something without using the mouse, press `f` to show the hints, then type the keys next to what you want to click on (if that sounds weird, then just try pressing `f` and see what happens)
- Press `:` to show the commandline
- To search in a page, press `/`, type the phrase to search for, then press Enter. Use `n` and `N` to go back and forth through the matches, and press Esc to stop doing the search.
- To close qutebrowser, press `Alt-F4`, or `:q`, or `:wq` to save the currently open tabs and quit (note that in the settings you can make qutebrowser always save the currently open tabs)
