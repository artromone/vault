In C++, a destructor is a special member function that is automatically called when an object of a class is destroyed or goes out of scope (когда объект выходит за **пределы области** или явно уничтожается вызовом **`delete`**).

It is used to [[perform]] any necessary cleanup operations before the object is destroyed and its memory is freed.

A class can only have one destructor, which is automatically generated by the compiler if it is not defined explicitly. However, a destructor can also be defined explicitly in the class definition to customize the behavior of the class during destruction.

```c++
class MyClass {
public:
    ~MyClass(); // destructor

private:
    int* myArray;
};

MyClass::~MyClass() {
    delete[] myArray;
}
```

It is important to note that the destructor is not called if an object is not properly destroyed, such as when it is leaked or deleted incorrectly. This can lead to memory leaks and other problems in the program. Therefore, it is important to ensure that objects of a class are always properly destroyed to avoid these issues.
